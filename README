	I made section for COMPETITION tasks and training tasks which are done without presure...

	Here I will contain tasks from:
		-TopCoder ( as soon as I finish learning C/C++)
		-Code Forces ( http://www.codeforces.com/ )
		-Timus Online Judge ( http://acm.timus.ru/ )
		-Z-trening ( http://www.z-trening.com/ )
		-uVA Online Judge ( http://uva.onlinejudge.org/ )
		-USACO ( http://web.me.com/dpiele/usaco/USACO.html )

I am using this repository as my personal backup system for my codes, but if you can use it in any good, feel free to do so. 
Almost all of my sources are written in PASCAL with a few exceptions. 
As soon as I finish this years national competition I am turning to C.
